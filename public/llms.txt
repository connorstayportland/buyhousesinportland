# Buy Houses in Portland

> Licensed Oregon real estate agents specializing in off-market home sales to cash buyers and investors throughout the greater Portland metro area.

## What We Do

We represent home sellers as licensed Oregon real estate agents and connect them directly with our network of cash buyers and active developers — without putting the property on the MLS. Our model is built around what the seller needs to walk away with, not what the market will bear after months of showings, repairs, and contingencies.

We purchase select properties directly when they fit our investment criteria. For all others, we represent the seller and source the right buyer from our investor network. Either way, sellers have licensed agent representation throughout the entire process.

## Who We Help

- Homeowners who need to sell quickly due to job relocation, divorce, inheritance, or financial pressure
- Landlords tired of managing rental properties
- Owners of distressed, damaged, or dated properties that are not competitive on the retail market
- Sellers who want to avoid the cost and disruption of traditional listing (repairs, staging, showings, open houses)
- Estate situations requiring fast, clean resolution
- Anyone who has a specific number they need to walk away with

## How It Works

1. **Tell us about your property** — submit the form or call 503-927-2565
2. **Free consultation** — we assess your property and walk you through realistic numbers within 24 hours
3. **Offer** — we structure a deal around your target proceeds
4. **Close** — cash closing, no bank financing delays, no appraisals, no loan contingencies

## Key Differentiators

- Licensed Oregon agents (not unlicensed wholesalers or "we buy ugly houses" companies)
- Seller representation — we work for you, not the buyer
- Fee structure: built into the buyer side, not deducted from seller proceeds
- No repairs required — properties purchased as-is, any condition
- Off-market — no MLS listing, no public exposure
- Fast close — cash buyers only, no financing contingencies

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Are you licensed real estate agents or just investors?**
Both. We are licensed Oregon real estate agents who are also active developers and investors in the Portland market. This matters because it means we legally represent your interests in the transaction.

**How do you get paid?**
Our fee is structured on the buyer side of the transaction. We work with sellers to establish the number they need to walk away with, then source a buyer willing to pay enough above that number to cover our fee. Sellers do not write us a check from their proceeds.

**Does the house need to be in good condition?**
No. Cash buyers in our network purchase properties as-is, including homes needing major repairs, fire or water damage, code violations, or decades of deferred maintenance.

**How fast can this close?**
Much faster than a traditional sale. Without bank financing, appraisals, or loan contingencies, most transactions in our network close in a fraction of the time of a typical listed sale.

**What areas do you cover?**
All of greater Portland — every Portland neighborhood plus Beaverton, Gresham, Lake Oswego, Hillsboro, Tigard, Tualatin, Milwaukie, Happy Valley, Oregon City, Clackamas, and Aloha. Call 503-927-2565 if you're unsure about your location.
