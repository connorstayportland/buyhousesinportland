    question: "How do you determine your cash offer?",
    answer:
      "We evaluate your home based on its location, size, condition, and recent comparable sales in the Portland area. We account for the cost of any repairs we'll need to make, our holding costs, and a reasonable profit margin. Our goal is to give you the fairest offer possible while also making the deal work for us.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will you really buy my house in any condition?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We've purchased homes with fire damage, foundation issues, mold, roof problems, hoarder situations, and more. You never need to clean, repair, or even move everything out — we handle it all after closing.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can you really close?",
    answer:
      "We can close in as little as 7 days in most cases. The primary variable is the title search and any liens or title issues that need to be resolved. Most of our Portland closings happen within 10–14 days. We can also close on your timeline if you need more time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any fees or commissions?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely none. We are not real estate agents — we are direct buyers. You pay zero commissions, zero agent fees, and in most cases we cover your closing costs too. The offer we make is the amount you receive.",
  },
  {
    question: "Am I obligated to accept the offer?",
    answer:
      "No. Our cash offer is 100% free and there's no obligation whatsoever. You can request an offer, review it, and walk away at any time — no pressure, no fees. We believe in giving you all the information you need to make the best decision for your situation.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my house has tenants?",
    answer:
      "We regularly purchase rental properties with tenants in place. We understand Oregon landlord-tenant law and will work within it. You don't need to evict your tenants before selling to us.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from listing with an agent?",
    answer:
      "Listing with an agent means showings, open houses, waiting for offers, financing contingencies, inspections, and typically 45–90 days before closing — with 5–6% in commissions deducted at the end. Selling to us means a private sale, no showings, cash in 7–14 days, and zero fees. The trade-off is that our offer may be slightly below market value, but many sellers find the speed, certainty, and savings on fees more than make up for it.",
  },
  {
    question: "What areas of Portland do you serve?",
    answer:
      "We buy homes throughout the greater Portland metro area including all Portland neighborhoods, Beaverton, Gresham, Lake Oswego, Hillsboro, Tigard, Tualatin, Milwaukie, Happy Valley, Oregon City, and Clackamas. Call us if you're unsure about your specific area.",
