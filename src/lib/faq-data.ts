    question: "How does this work if you're licensed agents — aren't you just a real estate team?",
    answer:
      "We're licensed Oregon agents, but we operate very differently from a traditional listing team. We don't put your home on the MLS, hold open houses, or wait for a retail buyer with bank financing. Instead, we take your property directly to our network of cash buyers and investors, structure the deal around what you need to walk away with, and close without the delays of a traditional sale.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you get paid if you're representing me?",
    answer:
      "Our fee is built into the transaction on the buyer side — meaning we structure the sale price so that your proceeds meet your number, and our fee is covered by what the buyer pays above that. You're not writing us a check out of your proceeds. As your agents, we are required to disclose this structure to you upfront, and we will.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to know what my house is worth before reaching out?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. A big part of what we do in that initial conversation is help you understand what your property is realistically worth to a cash buyer in its current condition. We'll walk you through the numbers transparently so you can make an informed decision about whether this path makes sense for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will you buy my house yourselves, or are you always finding an outside buyer?",
    answer:
      "Both, depending on the property. We purchase select properties directly when they fit our investment criteria. For everything else, we represent you and find the right buyer from our investor network. Either way, you have licensed agent representation throughout the process.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does my house need to be in good condition?",
    answer:
      "No. The buyers in our network purchase properties as-is — including homes needing significant repairs, deferred maintenance, fire or water damage, or properties that haven't been updated in decades. You don't need to clean, repair, or do anything to the property before we talk.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can this close?",
    answer:
      "Significantly faster than a traditional sale. Because we're working with cash buyers, there's no bank financing to wait on, no appraisal, and no loan contingencies. Once you accept an offer, the main variable is the title search and any existing liens. Most transactions in our network close well within the timeframe of a typical financed sale.",
  },
  {
    question: "Am I locked in if I reach out?",
    answer:
      "No. Our initial conversation is a free, no-pressure consultation. You're under no obligation at any point until you sign a purchase agreement. We want you to feel fully informed before making any decision.",
  },
  {
    question: "What areas do you serve?",
    answer:
      "We work throughout the greater Portland metro area — all Portland neighborhoods plus surrounding cities in Multnomah, Washington, and Clackamas counties, including Beaverton, Gresham, Lake Oswego, Hillsboro, Tigard, Tualatin, Milwaukie, Happy Valley, Oregon City, and Clackamas. Call us at 503-927-2565 if you're unsure whether we cover your area.",
